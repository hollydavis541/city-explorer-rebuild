**Author**: Holly Davis  
**Version**: 1.0.0  

## Overview
Create a Node.js server that connects to APIs that provide weather, restaurant, movie, and trail information to the [City Explorer site](city-explorer-code301.netlify.com). 

## Getting Started
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone it to your computer
3. Enter the following in your command line in the root directory for the repo: $ touch .env
4. Add your API keys and database url to the .env file
5. Confirm that node is installed: $ node -v (if not installed, do so)
6. To start your server: $ nodemon
7. Go to city-explorer-code301.netlify.com and enter "http://localhost:3000" in the field. Search for a city and you should see the location and weather information. 

## Architecture
This is a Node.js server that uses express, dotenv, cors, pg, and superagent packages.
